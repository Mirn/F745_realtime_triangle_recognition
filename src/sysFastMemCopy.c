/******************************************************************************
 *
 * Function Name:  sysFastMemCopy
 *
 * Description: Assuming that your processor can do 32-bit memory accesses
 * and contains a barrel shifter and that you are using an efficient
 * compiler, then this memory-to-memory copy procedure will probably be more
 * efficient than just using the traditional memcpy procedure if the number
 * of bytes to copy is greater than about 20.  It works by doing 32-bit
 * reads and writes instead of using 8-bit memory accesses.
 *
 * NOTE that this procedure assumes a Little Endian processor!  The shift
 * operators ">>" and "<<" should all be reversed for Big Endian.
 *
 * NEVER use this when the number of bytes to be copied is less than about
 * 10, since it may not work for a small number of bytes.  Also, do not use
 * this when the source and destination regions overlap.
 *
 * NOTE that this may NOT be faster than memcpy if your processor supports a
 * really fast cache memory!
 *
 * Timing for this sysFastMemCopy varies some according to which shifts need
 * to be done.  The following results are from one attempt to measure timing
 * on a Cortex M4 processor running at 48 MHz.

 *
 * The following macro can be used instead of memcpy to automatically select
 * whether to use memcpy or sysFastMemCopy:
 *
 *   #define MEMCOPY(pDst,pSrc,len) \
 *     (len) < 16 ? memcpy(pDst,pSrc,len) : sysFastMemCopy(pDst,pSrc,len);
